## VM vs Docker

### VM
* Diverse OS
* builtin isolation. sudo access is restricted to the VM
* legacy? well-suited for running specific versions which may be incompatible with host

### Docker
* microservices due to lightweight, quick start
* rapid development, deployment, scale
* resource efficient due to smaller footprint
* con: requires thought on how to prevent root access
